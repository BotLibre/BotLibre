<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 1</pattern><template>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 2</pattern><template>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 3</pattern><template>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 4</pattern><template>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 5</pattern><template>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 6</pattern><template>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 7</pattern><template>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 9</pattern><template>But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 10</pattern><template>Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 1 11</pattern><template>O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 1</pattern><template>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 2</pattern><template>Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 3</pattern><template>And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 4</pattern><template>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 5</pattern><template>And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 6</pattern><template>And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 7</pattern><template>Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;</template></category>

And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 9</pattern><template>Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 11</pattern><template>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 12</pattern><template>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 13</pattern><template>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 14</pattern><template>Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 15</pattern><template>Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 16</pattern><template>And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 17</pattern><template>Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 18</pattern><template>Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 19</pattern><template>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 2 20</pattern><template>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 3 1</pattern><template>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 1</pattern><template>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 2</pattern><template>And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 3</pattern><template>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 4</pattern><template>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 5</pattern><template>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 6</pattern><template>So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 7</pattern><template>But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 8</pattern><template>And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 9</pattern><template>Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 10</pattern><template>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 11</pattern><template>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 12</pattern><template>And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 13</pattern><template>Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 14</pattern><template>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 15</pattern><template>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 16</pattern><template>And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 17</pattern><template>They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 18</pattern><template>For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 19</pattern><template>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 20</pattern><template>In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 21</pattern><template>So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 22</pattern><template>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 4 23</pattern><template>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 1</pattern><template>And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 2</pattern><template>For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 3</pattern><template>Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 4</pattern><template>There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 5</pattern><template>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 6</pattern><template>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 7</pattern><template>Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 8</pattern><template>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 9</pattern><template>Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 10</pattern><template>I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 11</pattern><template>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 12</pattern><template>Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 13</pattern><template>Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 14</pattern><template>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 15</pattern><template>But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 16</pattern><template>Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 17</pattern><template>Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 18</pattern><template>Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 5 19</pattern><template>Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 1</pattern><template>Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 2</pattern><template>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 3</pattern><template>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 4</pattern><template>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 5</pattern><template>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 6</pattern><template>Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 7</pattern><template>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 8</pattern><template>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 9</pattern><template>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 10</pattern><template>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 11</pattern><template>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 12</pattern><template>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 13</pattern><template>Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 14</pattern><template>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 15</pattern><template>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 16</pattern><template>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 17</pattern><template>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 18</pattern><template>For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 6 19</pattern><template>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 7 1</pattern><template>Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 7 2</pattern><template>That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 7 3</pattern><template>And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Nehemiah 7 4</pattern><template>Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.</template></category>
