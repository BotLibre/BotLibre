<category><pattern>Amos 6 2</pattern><template>Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Amos 6 3</pattern><template>Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</template></category>

<category><pattern>Amos 7 6</pattern><template>The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Amos 7 7</pattern><template>Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</template></category>
