<category><pattern>Jeremiah 2 8</pattern><template>The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Jeremiah 2 9</pattern><template>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Jeremiah 2 20</pattern><template>For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Jeremiah 2 21</pattern><template>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</template></category>
