<category><pattern>Numbers 33 55</pattern><template>But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Numbers 35 8</pattern><template>And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 9</pattern><template>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 10</pattern><template>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 11</pattern><template>Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Numbers 35 16</pattern><template>And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 17</pattern><template>And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 18</pattern><template>Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 19</pattern><template>The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 20</pattern><template>But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 21</pattern><template>Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 22</pattern><template>But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 23</pattern><template>Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm:</template></category>

<category><pattern>Numbers 35 32</pattern><template>And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 33</pattern><template>So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 35 34</pattern><template>Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Numbers 36 4</pattern><template>And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 36 5</pattern><template>And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Numbers 36 10</pattern><template>Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Numbers 36 11</pattern><template>For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:</template></category>
