<category><pattern>Matthew 1 6</pattern><template>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 7</pattern><template>And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 8</pattern><template>And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 1 11</pattern><template>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 12</pattern><template>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 1 16</pattern><template>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 17</pattern><template>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 18</pattern><template>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 19</pattern><template>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 20</pattern><template>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 21</pattern><template>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 22</pattern><template>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 23</pattern><template>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 24</pattern><template>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 1 25</pattern><template>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 1</pattern><template>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 2</pattern><template>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 3</pattern><template>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 4</pattern><template>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 5</pattern><template>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 6</pattern><template>And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 7</pattern><template>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 8</pattern><template>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 9</pattern><template>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 10</pattern><template>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 11</pattern><template>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 12</pattern><template>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 13</pattern><template>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 14</pattern><template>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 15</pattern><template>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 16</pattern><template>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 17</pattern><template>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 18</pattern><template>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 19</pattern><template>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 20</pattern><template>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 21</pattern><template>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 22</pattern><template>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 2 23</pattern><template>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 1</pattern><template>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 2</pattern><template>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 3</pattern><template>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 4</pattern><template>And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 5</pattern><template>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 6</pattern><template>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 7</pattern><template>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 8</pattern><template>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 9</pattern><template>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 10</pattern><template>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 11</pattern><template>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 12</pattern><template>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 13</pattern><template>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 14</pattern><template>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 15</pattern><template>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 16</pattern><template>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 3 17</pattern><template>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 1</pattern><template>Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 2</pattern><template>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 3</pattern><template>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 4</pattern><template>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 5</pattern><template>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 6</pattern><template>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 7</pattern><template>Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 8</pattern><template>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 9</pattern><template>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 10</pattern><template>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 11</pattern><template>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 12</pattern><template>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 13</pattern><template>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 14</pattern><template>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 15</pattern><template>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 16</pattern><template>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 17</pattern><template>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 18</pattern><template>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 19</pattern><template>And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 20</pattern><template>And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 21</pattern><template>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 22</pattern><template>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 23</pattern><template>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 24</pattern><template>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 4 25</pattern><template>And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 1</pattern><template>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 2</pattern><template>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 3</pattern><template>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 4</pattern><template>Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 5</pattern><template>Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 6</pattern><template>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 7</pattern><template>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 8</pattern><template>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 9</pattern><template>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 10</pattern><template>Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 11</pattern><template>Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 12</pattern><template>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 13</pattern><template>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 14</pattern><template>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 15</pattern><template>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 16</pattern><template>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 17</pattern><template>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 18</pattern><template>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 19</pattern><template>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 20</pattern><template>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 21</pattern><template>Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 22</pattern><template>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 23</pattern><template>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 24</pattern><template>Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 25</pattern><template>Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 26</pattern><template>Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 27</pattern><template>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 28</pattern><template>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 29</pattern><template>And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 30</pattern><template>And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 31</pattern><template>It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 32</pattern><template>But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 33</pattern><template>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 34</pattern><template>But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 35</pattern><template>Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 36</pattern><template>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 37</pattern><template>But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 38</pattern><template>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 39</pattern><template>But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 40</pattern><template>And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 41</pattern><template>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 42</pattern><template>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 43</pattern><template>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 44</pattern><template>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 45</pattern><template>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 46</pattern><template>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 47</pattern><template>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 5 48</pattern><template>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 1</pattern><template>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 2</pattern><template>Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 3</pattern><template>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 4</pattern><template>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 5</pattern><template>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 6</pattern><template>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 7</pattern><template>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 8</pattern><template>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 9</pattern><template>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 10</pattern><template>Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 11</pattern><template>Give us this day our daily bread.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 12</pattern><template>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 6 14</pattern><template>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 15</pattern><template>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 16</pattern><template>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 17</pattern><template>But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 18</pattern><template>That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 6 19</pattern><template>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 13 44</pattern><template>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 13 45</pattern><template>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 14 34</pattern><template>And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 14 35</pattern><template>And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 14 36</pattern><template>And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 1</pattern><template>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 2</pattern><template>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 3</pattern><template>But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 4</pattern><template>For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 5</pattern><template>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 6</pattern><template>And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 7</pattern><template>Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 8</pattern><template>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 9</pattern><template>But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 10</pattern><template>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 11</pattern><template>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 12</pattern><template>Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 13</pattern><template>But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 14</pattern><template>Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 15</pattern><template>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 16</pattern><template>And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 17</pattern><template>Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 18</pattern><template>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 19</pattern><template>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 20</pattern><template>These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 21</pattern><template>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 22</pattern><template>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 23</pattern><template>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 24</pattern><template>But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 25</pattern><template>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 26</pattern><template>But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 27</pattern><template>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 15 30</pattern><template>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 31</pattern><template>Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 32</pattern><template>Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 33</pattern><template>And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 34</pattern><template>And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 35</pattern><template>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 15 36</pattern><template>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 16 1</pattern><template>The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 16 3</pattern><template>And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 4</pattern><template>A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 5</pattern><template>And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 6</pattern><template>Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 7</pattern><template>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 8</pattern><template>Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 9</pattern><template>Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 10</pattern><template>Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 11</pattern><template>How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 12</pattern><template>Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 13</pattern><template>When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 14</pattern><template>And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 15</pattern><template>He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 16</pattern><template>And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 17</pattern><template>And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 18</pattern><template>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 19</pattern><template>And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 20</pattern><template>Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 21</pattern><template>From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 22</pattern><template>Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 23</pattern><template>But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 24</pattern><template>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 25</pattern><template>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 26</pattern><template>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 27</pattern><template>For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 16 28</pattern><template>Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 17 3</pattern><template>And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 4</pattern><template>Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 5</pattern><template>While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 6</pattern><template>And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 7</pattern><template>And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 8</pattern><template>And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 9</pattern><template>And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 10</pattern><template>And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 11</pattern><template>And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 12</pattern><template>But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 13</pattern><template>Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 14</pattern><template>And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 15</pattern><template>Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 16</pattern><template>And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 17</pattern><template>Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 18</pattern><template>And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 19</pattern><template>Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 20</pattern><template>And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 21</pattern><template>Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 22</pattern><template>And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 23</pattern><template>And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 24</pattern><template>And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 25</pattern><template>He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 26</pattern><template>Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 17 27</pattern><template>Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 1</pattern><template>At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 2</pattern><template>And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 3</pattern><template>And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 4</pattern><template>Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 5</pattern><template>And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 6</pattern><template>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 7</pattern><template>Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 8</pattern><template>Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 9</pattern><template>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 10</pattern><template>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 11</pattern><template>For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 12</pattern><template>How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 13</pattern><template>And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 14</pattern><template>Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 15</pattern><template>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 16</pattern><template>But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 17</pattern><template>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 18</pattern><template>Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 19</pattern><template>Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 20</pattern><template>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 21</pattern><template>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 18 23</pattern><template>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 24</pattern><template>And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 25</pattern><template>But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 26</pattern><template>The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 27</pattern><template>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 28</pattern><template>But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 29</pattern><template>And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 30</pattern><template>And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 31</pattern><template>So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 32</pattern><template>Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 33</pattern><template>Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 34</pattern><template>And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 18 35</pattern><template>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 19 7</pattern><template>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 19 8</pattern><template>He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 19 9</pattern><template>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 19 10</pattern><template>His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 19 11</pattern><template>But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 19 12</pattern><template>For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 19 13</pattern><template>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 25 21</pattern><template>His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 25 24</pattern><template>Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 25</pattern><template>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 26</pattern><template>His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</template></category>

<category><pattern>Matthew 25 35</pattern><template>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 36</pattern><template>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 37</pattern><template>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 38</pattern><template>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 39</pattern><template>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 40</pattern><template>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 41</pattern><template>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 42</pattern><template>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 43</pattern><template>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 44</pattern><template>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 45</pattern><template>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 25 46</pattern><template>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 1</pattern><template>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 2</pattern><template>Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 3</pattern><template>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 4</pattern><template>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 5</pattern><template>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 6</pattern><template>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 7</pattern><template>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 8</pattern><template>But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 9</pattern><template>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 10</pattern><template>When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 11</pattern><template>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 12</pattern><template>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 13</pattern><template>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 14</pattern><template>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 15</pattern><template>And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 16</pattern><template>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 17</pattern><template>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 18</pattern><template>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 19</pattern><template>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 20</pattern><template>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 21</pattern><template>And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 22</pattern><template>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 23</pattern><template>And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 24</pattern><template>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 25</pattern><template>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 26</pattern><template>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 27</pattern><template>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 28</pattern><template>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 29</pattern><template>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 30</pattern><template>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 31</pattern><template>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 32</pattern><template>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 33</pattern><template>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 34</pattern><template>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 35</pattern><template>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 36</pattern><template>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 37</pattern><template>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 38</pattern><template>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 39</pattern><template>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 40</pattern><template>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 41</pattern><template>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 42</pattern><template>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 43</pattern><template>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 44</pattern><template>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 45</pattern><template>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 46</pattern><template>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 47</pattern><template>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 48</pattern><template>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 49</pattern><template>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 50</pattern><template>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 51</pattern><template>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 52</pattern><template>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 53</pattern><template>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 54</pattern><template>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 55</pattern><template>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 56</pattern><template>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 57</pattern><template>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 58</pattern><template>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 59</pattern><template>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 60</pattern><template>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 61</pattern><template>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 62</pattern><template>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 63</pattern><template>But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 64</pattern><template>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 65</pattern><template>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 66</pattern><template>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 67</pattern><template>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 68</pattern><template>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 69</pattern><template>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 70</pattern><template>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 71</pattern><template>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 72</pattern><template>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 73</pattern><template>And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 74</pattern><template>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 26 75</pattern><template>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 1</pattern><template>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 2</pattern><template>And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 3</pattern><template>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 4</pattern><template>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 5</pattern><template>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 6</pattern><template>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 7</pattern><template>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 8</pattern><template>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 9</pattern><template>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 10</pattern><template>And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 11</pattern><template>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 12</pattern><template>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 13</pattern><template>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 14</pattern><template>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 15</pattern><template>Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 16</pattern><template>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 17</pattern><template>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 18</pattern><template>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 19</pattern><template>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 20</pattern><template>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 21</pattern><template>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 22</pattern><template>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 23</pattern><template>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 24</pattern><template>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 25</pattern><template>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 26</pattern><template>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 27</pattern><template>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 28</pattern><template>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 29</pattern><template>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 30</pattern><template>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 31</pattern><template>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 32</pattern><template>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 33</pattern><template>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 34</pattern><template>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 35</pattern><template>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 36</pattern><template>And sitting down they watched him there;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 37</pattern><template>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 38</pattern><template>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 39</pattern><template>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 40</pattern><template>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 41</pattern><template>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 42</pattern><template>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 43</pattern><template>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 44</pattern><template>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 45</pattern><template>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 46</pattern><template>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 47</pattern><template>Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 48</pattern><template>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 49</pattern><template>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 50</pattern><template>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 51</pattern><template>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 52</pattern><template>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 53</pattern><template>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 54</pattern><template>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 55</pattern><template>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 56</pattern><template>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 57</pattern><template>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 58</pattern><template>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 59</pattern><template>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 60</pattern><template>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 61</pattern><template>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 62</pattern><template>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 63</pattern><template>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 64</pattern><template>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 65</pattern><template>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 27 66</pattern><template>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 1</pattern><template>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 2</pattern><template>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 3</pattern><template>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 4</pattern><template>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 5</pattern><template>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 6</pattern><template>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 7</pattern><template>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 8</pattern><template>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 9</pattern><template>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 10</pattern><template>Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 11</pattern><template>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 12</pattern><template>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 13</pattern><template>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 14</pattern><template>And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 15</pattern><template>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 16</pattern><template>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 17</pattern><template>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 18</pattern><template>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 19</pattern><template>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</template></category>
<category><pattern>Matthew 28 20</pattern><template>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</template></category>
